      This project, <em>SmartTrack – Expense Manager</em>, is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
      It helps users track their daily income and expenses, calculate their remaining balance,  
      and manage all records directly from their browser using Local Storage.  
      <br><br>
      The project demonstrates front-end web development skills including:
      HTML structure design, CSS-based user interface, and JavaScript-based interactivity and data handling.
